## Description

Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier for multi-class classification using Scikit-learn is developed, trained and deployed using ONNX. The data set for this project is very skewed, which is always a disadvantage when developing the classifier. This imbalance is rectified using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) this is a technique that generates samples for the minority class thus reducing the imbalance. Machine learning algorithms, of which the scikit-learn is one of the most well-known data science libraries in Python, contain a variety of methods for their implementation. ONNX or Open Neural Network Exchange is a standard for shared exchange of deep learning models to make their deployment on diverse platforms, especially, on devices preferable for real-time application. This work proposal introduces the new classification pipeline that incorporates data preprocessing, feature space engineering, model learning, and model assessment, as well as the ONNXd porting of the learned model. The problem is not only in constructing a good model, but also in its ability to be deployed in resource-constrained environments such as the edge devices that need to run fast whilst consuming low amounts of power. The effectiveness of the ONNX model will also be assessed as suitable for deployment when it is compared with the original Scikit-learn model.
